## Introduction

**Jetscan is a portable 3D dense reconstruction system based on**

1. [Jetson nano by NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
2. [Intel Realsense D400 series depth camera](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435i/)
3. [Open3D ](http://www.open3d.org/) by INTEL ISL
4. [theNded's CUDA implementation](https://github.com/theNded/Open3D)

## Software Setup

* For setting up the software stack, follow instructions in 
  
  Sofware_O3D - [Software setup](https://github.com/devshank3/JetScan/blob/master/Software_O3D/README.md)

* Complete software repo is [here](https://github.com/devshank3/Open3D-for-Jetson) (forked from Open3D) 

    https://github.com/devshank3/Open3D-for-Jetson

    its built on [theNded's](https://github.com/theNded) CUDA implementation 
***

## Hardware Setup

Follow instructions in 

1. Hardware_electronics - [Electronics setup](https://github.com/devshank3/JetScan/blob/master/Hardware_electronics/README.md)

2. Hardware_casing - [Case/Closure setup](https://github.com/devshank3/JetScan/blob/master/Hardware_casing/README.md)

***

Follow **https://github.com/devshank3/JetScan/blob/master/Software_O3D/README.md** for Software Setup

## Usage 

* Step 1 : Go to **Open3D-for-Jetson/Reconstruction_Jetscan_Hybrid/**

* Step 2 : Edit **Main_gui.py**

    set your system executable path to Run_MakeFragments,ViewPoseGraph,Run_IntegrateScene

    eg.

       os.system('/home/shank/Projects/3D_processing/jetscan/jetscan-final-edit/Open3D-for-Jetson/build/bin/examples/./Run_MakeFragments')

                                                              ⇩⇩⇩ to ⇩⇩⇩                       

       os.system('your_system _path/Open3D-for-Jetson/build/bin/examples/./Run_MakeFragments')

 * Step 3: Run the UI (in  virtual env if setup)

   > $ python3 Main_gui.py

* Step 4 : Start the Reconstruction

     **Capture RGB-D**

     Captures the RGB-D sequence

     **Reconstruct Scene**

     The hybrid reconstruction system starts with the RGB-D sequence recorded
